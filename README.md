# JavaScript Technologies  
Following are the javacript features, I used to create the app.  
==> Constructor function to create objects.  
==> Use of 'call' method to convert the Nodelist into an array.  
==> Custom forEach to use it on nodelists.  
==> IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).  
==> Closures ....  etc  
Please suggest me ways to update my project and make my code better.
